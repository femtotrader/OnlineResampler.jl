## 2. Risk Assessment

### 2.1 Code Quality and Correctness

| Risk | Level | Details | Mitigation |
|------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Logic Errors** | Medium | AI may introduce subtle bugs | 94 test scenarios, human review |
| **Edge Cases** | Medium | AI may miss uncommon scenarios | Comprehensive test suite, real-world validation |
| **Type Safety** | Low | Strong Julia type system | Type-stable implementations |
| **API Consistency** | Low | AI follows patterns well | OnlineStatsBase conventions |

**Specific Concerns:**
- Window boundary conditions in volume/tick-based resampling
- Numeric overflow/underflow with extreme values
- Timestamp edge cases (leap seconds, DST, etc.)
- Concurrent access patterns (not thread-safe by design)

**Evidence of Quality:**
- 94 BDD test scenarios, all passing
- >90% code coverage
- Type-stable implementations (verified)
- Zero allocation in hot paths (benchmarked)

### 2.2 Security Considerations

| Aspect | Risk Level | Details |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Input Validation** | Low | Relies on Julia's type system |
| **External Dependencies** | Low | Only OnlineStatsBase and Dates |
| **Code Injection** | None | No eval or code generation |
| **Data Leakage** | None | No network/file I/O |
| **Memory Safety** | Low | Pure Julia, managed memory |

**Security Strengths:**
- No external network calls
- No file system access
- No code evaluation (eval, include)
- Minimal dependencies (OnlineStatsBase, Dates)
- Immutable data structures where appropriate

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- DoS via infinite loops (mitigated: window-based processing)
- Memory exhaustion (mitigated: constant memory usage)
- Numeric overflow (user responsibility for type selection)

### 2.3 Maintenance and Code Understanding

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Code Comprehension** | Medium | AI code can be harder to understand | Extensive documentation, clear naming |
| **Debugging Difficulty** | Medium | Generated code may lack intuition | Comprehensive tests, examples |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Medium | Original developer context limited | EARS spec, BDD tests as documentation |
| **Future Modifications** | Medium | May be harder to extend | Well-structured, follows Julia idioms |

**Maintainability Features:**
- Comprehensive docstrings
- BDD tests serve as living documentation
- EARS specification provides design rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Follows OnlineStatsBase patterns

### 2.4 Edge Case Coverage
